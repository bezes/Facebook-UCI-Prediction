## Contents

- README.md
- requirements.txt
- model.py
- preparation.py
- EDA.ipynb
- Model.ipynb

## How to execute:

Requirements: python 3.7

While on a virtual environment, install the libraries required using:
`
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

Then launch a jupyter notebook:
`jupyter notebook`

And you can open and run the notebooks `EDA.ipynb` and `model.ipynb`.

## Future work:

- Tests
- Productionisation
    - Tune the regressors on a regular basis
    - Save the selected model parameters to database
    - Predict based on the selected model
    - Re-train regularly
- More advanced EDA
